# Introduction
The main aim of developing this website is to provide manufacturers a platform where they can have their store online and retailers can get the catalogue 24x7 whenever they need it. In India retailing business is increasing rapidly.  Using this website, the manufacturers can automate the process of delivering products all over India, the retailers can also get product catalogue, and can order online anytime and from anywhere. In order to help retailers and manufacturers to get things done very quick and easy, our web application can be used.  Retailers are also provided with filters like gender category, and clothing category so they can filter out the product and see only those products which they want, hence our website provide minimalistic design.  Using this B2B ecommerce website retailers can register themselves on the platform and can get product catalogue from all manufacturers at one place they need not to go to every other manufacturer to see their catalogue. Also, the manufacturers can register and showcase their products online to very large number of retailers at once.  For retailers to register they have been provided with a form which they can fill and use the same details to login and order products. For manufactures, they need to fill contact us form and out team will get in touch with them and they will be allowed to access the manufacturers panel once any of the admin approves the manufacturer. The manufacturer then adds products, check orders, etc. Manufacturers will be allotted with separate Id’s and password. 
Our website is easy to understand and is available to small as well as large scale manufacturers or retailers. 

# Problem Definition
At present, if someone is a manufacturer they need to have a very good market value to sell their products to retailers, and same applies to retailers, if someone wants more products in the retailing shop they need to go to different cities and look for goods, also they must have knowledge about it but using this system they can easily check products from manufacturers thousands of kilometers away also they can order from home and get those products delivered without going anywhere. There is no system for a proper business to business e-commerce in India. While manually there are problems of managing the bills and records. If the retailer is new in the market, then it is very difficult for him to find manufacturers. And hence our web application can be implemented to solve this problem.
